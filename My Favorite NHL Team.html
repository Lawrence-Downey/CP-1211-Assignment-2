<p><h3>Every Maple Leaf fan has found themselves at the butt end of a joke at some point in their life.  The reason being, that the Leafs (while icing extremely talented teams over the decades)<br>
    have not won a Stanley Cup since 1967. In fact, the last time a member of the organization hoisted the cup, televisions had no color.</h3>
